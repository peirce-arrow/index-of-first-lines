"0 From fairest creatures we desire increase,"
1 When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
2 Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
"3 Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend"
4 Those hours that with gentle work did frame
5 Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface
"6 Lo, in the orient when the gracious light"
"7 Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?"
8 Is it for fear to wet a widow’s eye
"9 For shame deny that thou bear’st love to any,"
"10 As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow’st"
11 When I do count the clock that tells the time
"12 O, that you were your self! But, love, you are"
"13 Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,"
14 When I consider everything that grows
15 But wherefore do not you a mightier way
16 Who will believe my verse in time to come
17 Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
"18 Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion’s paws"
19 A woman’s face with Nature’s own hand painted
20 So is it not with me as with that muse
21 My glass shall not persuade me I am old
22 As an unperfect actor on the stage
23 Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
24 Let those who are in favor with their stars
"25 Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage"
"26 Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,"
27 How can I then return in happy plight
"28 When in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,"
29 When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
30 Thy bosom is endearèd with all hearts
31 If thou survive my well-contented day
32 Full many a glorious morning have I seen
33 Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
34 No more be grieved at that which thou hast done.
35 Let me confess that we two must be twain
36 As a decrepit father takes delight
37 How can my muse want subject to invent
"38 O, how thy worth with manners may I sing"
"39 Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all."
40 Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
"41 That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,"
"42 When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,"
"43 If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,"
"44 The other two, slight air and purging fire,"
45 Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
"46 Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,"
"47 How careful was I, when I took my way,"
"48 Against that time, if ever that time come,"
"49 How heavy do I journey on the way,"
50 Thus can my love excuse the slow offense
51 So am I as the rich whose blessèd key
"52 What is your substance, whereof are you made,"
"53 O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem"
54 Not marble nor the gilded monuments
"55 Sweet love, renew thy force. Be it not said"
"56 Being your slave, what should I do but tend"
"57 That god forbid, that made me first your slave,"
"58 If there be nothing new, but that which is"
"59 Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,"
60 Is it thy will thy image should keep open
61 Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
"62 Against my love shall be, as I am now,"
63 When I have seen by Time’s fell hand defaced
"64 Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea"
"65 Tired with all these, for restful death I cry:"
"66 Ah, wherefore with infection should he live,"
"67 Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,"
68 Those parts of thee that the world’s eye doth view
"69 That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,"
70 No longer mourn for me when I am dead
"71 O, lest the world should task you to recite"
72 That time of year thou mayst in me behold
73 But be contented when that fell arrest
"74 So are you to my thoughts as food to life,"
"75 Why is my verse so barren of new pride,"
"76 Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,"
77 So oft have I invoked thee for my muse
"78 Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,"
"79 O, how I faint when I of you do write,"
80 Or I shall live your epitaph to make
"81 I grant thou wert not married to my muse,"
82 I never saw that you did painting need
"83 Who is it that says most, which can say more"
84 My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still
"85 Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,"
"86 Farewell, thou art too dear for my possessing,"
87 When thou shalt be disposed to set me light
"88 Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,"
"89 Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,"
"90 Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,"
"91 But do thy worst to steal thyself away,"
"92 So shall I live, supposing thou art true,"
"93 They that have power to hurt and will do none,"
94 How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
"95 Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;"
96 How like a winter hath my absence been
"97 From you have I been absent in the spring,"
98 The forward violet thus did I chide:
"99 Where art thou, muse, that thou forget’st so long"
"100 O truant muse, what shall be thy amends"
"101 My love is strengthened, though more weak in seeming;"
"102 Alack, what poverty my muse brings forth,"
"103 To me, fair friend, you never can be old,"
"104 Let not my love be called idolatry,"
105 When in the chronicle of wasted time
106 Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
107 What’s in the brain that ink may character
"108 O, never say that I was false of heart,"
"109 Alas, ’tis true, I have gone here and there"
"110 O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,"
111 Your love and pity doth th’ impression fill
"112 Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind,"
"113 Or whether doth my mind, being crowned with you,"
"114 Those lines that I before have writ do lie,"
115 Let me not to the marriage of true minds
116 Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
117 Like as to make our appetites more keen
118 What potions have I drunk of siren tears
"119 That you were once unkind befriends me now,"
"120 ’Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed,"
"121 Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain"
"122 No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change."
"123 If my dear love were but the child of state,"
"124 Were ’t aught to me I bore the canopy,"
"125 O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power"
"126 In the old age, black was not counted fair,"
"127 How oft, when thou, my music, music play’st"
128 Th’ expense of spirit in a waste of shame
129 My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun;
"130 Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,"
"131 Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,"
132 Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
"133 So, now I have confessed that he is thine"
"134 Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,"
"135 If thy soul check thee that I come so near,"
"136 Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes"
137 When my love swears that she is made of truth
"138 O, call not me to justify the wrong"
139 Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
"140 In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,"
"141 Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,"
"142 Lo, as a careful huswife runs to catch"
"143 Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,"
144 Those lips that Love’s own hand did make
"145 Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,"
"146 My love is as a fever, longing still"
"147 O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,"
"148 Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not"
"149 O, from what power hast thou this powerful might"
150 Love is too young to know what conscience is;
"151 In loving thee thou know’st I am forsworn,"
152 Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
"153 The little love-god, lying once asleep,"
