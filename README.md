Test repo for final project reorganizing the first lines of shakespeare's sonnets


Project Title

"In Dex" 

Project Description

This project seeks to automate the production of a poetic text constructed entirely from the first lines of Shakespeare's sonnets. 

Shakespeare published 154 sonnets. One-hundred and fifty-four divided by fourteen (the line length of a Shakespearean sonnet), equals eleven.
That means we can use all of the first lines of the sonnets to construct eleven sonnets.
